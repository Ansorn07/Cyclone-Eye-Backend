            "question": "How are cyclones named?",
            "answer": "Countries in a particular region, including India, contribute to a shared list of names. The names are used one by one. This helps everyone easily identify and track the storms without confusion."

            "question": "What do the different color alerts mean?",
            "answer": "Alerts help us understand the danger level. Green means all is clear. Yellow means be aware and stay updated. Orange means be prepared for bad weather. Red means take action immediately, as dangerous weather is expected."

            "question": "Is it safe to go to the beach to watch a cyclone?",
